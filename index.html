      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Julia and I am so excited to become a Web Developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy riding my bicycle and taking my dog out for adventures in my new city!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>While I am less interested in the title of the job I would like to problem solve and minimize monotony. All jobs can become repetitive but having new things to solve while working in a group or team is ideal for me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Seattle, Washinton.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy creating. I never would have thought I would enjoy coding but after a friend of mine stated that it was more of a creative art than anything I took interest. I have the patients and curiosity to problem solve.</p>
